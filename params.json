[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Foscari)\r\n2. [Main-Page](http://www.lamalcontenta.com/) \r\n\r\n### Hierarchical decomposition of the model\r\nDuring to approach to the creation of three-dimensional model, we chose to hierarchically decompose the structure of the villa into five-plus-one contexts:\r\n* **The Basement:** _The Twin Stairs, the Colonnade-Basement and the Garden_\r\n* **The Main Building**\r\n* **The Colonnade** _(precisely, A column)_\r\n* **The Front Facade of the Villa:** _The Main Roof and the Tympanum_\r\n* **The Back-Side of the Villa:** _Circular Glass and Back Facade_\r\n* **All the other stuff:** _windows, banisters, gratings and chimneyspot_\r\n\r\n_Please note:_ the code has been implemented with `export` functions, which means each of such contexts it's independent from others and can be drawn singularly.\r\n![Export Function](http://imageshack.us/a/img96/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n\r\n### Twin Stairs and Colonnade-Basement\r\n\r\nDue its symmetrical nature, Villa Foscari can be split in a right-half and a left-half.\r\n\r\nIf we focus on the last one, we'll obtain the other half simply with a `S` trasformation.\r\nMoreover, Rotational trasformations, `R`, are used to create the upper side of the stairs and due its squareness, we'll use mostly `CUBOID` functions.\r\n![Twin Stairs](http://imageshack.us/a/img7/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n\r\nThe same trick can be used to draw the Colonnade_Basement, which is exactly between the twin stairs.\r\n\r\n![Colonnade Basement](http://imageshack.us/a/img94/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n\r\nHere you can see the final result, combining the stairs and the basement.\r\n\r\n![Final Result](http://imageshack.us/a/img839/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n### Main Building\r\nPlease notice that every window, before being applied to the model, passes through a `BOUNDARY` function for aesthetic purpose.\r\n![Main Building](http://imageshack.us/a/img801/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n\r\n### The Colonnade\r\nThe colonnade is the most complex part of the project as it was decided to model the capital as an Archimedean spiral drawn by a `NUBS` (Archimedean spiral). It was also used a light-domain to avoid overloading the global model.\r\n\r\nTo draw the column instead, we chose to adopt divide-and-conquer-approach:\r\n* _Column-Base_ with `NUBS` and `ROTATIONAL SURFACE`.\r\n* _Column-Shaft_ with a `CYLINDER_SURFACE`\r\n* _Column-Capital_ still with `NUBS` `ROTATIONAL SURFACE` and `BEZIER`\r\n![Column](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg805/scaled.php?server=805&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\nThe entire Colonnade, which is basically a column replicated and then translated through the function `REPLICA`, counts ten columns advisably placed upon the Colonnade Basement.\r\n\r\n![Colonnade](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg507/scaled.php?server=507&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n### The Main Roof and Tympanum\r\nThe tympanum has been modeled with `CUBOID` roto-traslated.\r\nThe Main Roof counts a `SCALE` colonnade-roof, combined with 2*`CUBOID` and 2*`TRIANGLE_DOMAIN` advisably rotated and translated.\r\n\r\n![Main Roof](http://imageshack.us/a/img803/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n\r\n### All together: The Front Facade\r\nHere you can have a view of all the previous contexts mixed together, forming the Main Facade:\r\n![The FrontFacade](http://imageshack.us/a/img534/1631/schermata20120925alle09.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Backside of the Villa\r\n\r\nWith its circular glass, along with its asymmetrical facade, the back-side of the villa is one of the most complex part of the model.\r\nThe glass just above the circular one, has been modeled by a `2D DOMAIN` and a `TRIANGLE_DOMAIN`.\r\n\r\n![The Backside](http://imageshack.us/a/img253/1631/schermata20120925alle09.png)\r\n\r\n### Last but not least: All the other stuff\r\n\r\nAt the end of our rendering process we did take care of details, such as:\r\n\r\n*  **_Gratings_**  \r\n![Gratings](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg585/scaled.php?server=585&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n*  **_Banisters_** \r\n![Banisters](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg69/scaled.php?server=69&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n*  **_Windows and Shutters_** \r\n![Window](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg594/scaled.php?server=594&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n* **_Chimneys-pot upon the Main roof_**\r\n![Chimneypots](http://imageshack.us/a/img545/3729/schermata092456190alle1.png)\r\n\r\n### Final View\r\nThe complete model, as a result of the union of each hierarchical level, is as follows:\r\n![All](http://imageshack.us/a/img267/8657/4ac84247243c4d8aae6fdd1.jpg)\r\n### More Comparisons\r\n* _The Front Facade_\r\n![Front Facade](http://imageshack.us/a/img534/1631/schermata20120925alle09.png)\r\n* _The Colonnade_\r\n![Colonnade](http://imageshack.us/a/img341/3017/6520858af6704540a0392a6.jpg)\r\n* _The Back-Side_\r\n![BS-Comparison](http://imageshack.us/a/img228/4724/6a29051d3f1f4e51a800532.jpg)\r\n* _A view of the Villa_\r\n![A view of a side of the villa](http://imageshack.us/a/img267/1631/schermata20120925alle09.png)\r\n* _Side view_\r\n![Side](http://imageshack.us/a/img221/1631/schermata20120925alle09.png)\r\n* _Sky view_\r\n![Sky](http://imageshack.us/a/img207/1631/schermata20120925alle09.png)","name":"Final Project"}
