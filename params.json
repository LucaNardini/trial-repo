[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Foscari)\r\n2. [Main-Page](http://www.lamalcontenta.com/) \r\n\r\n### Hierarchical decomposition of the model\r\nDuring to approach to the creation of three-dimensional model, we chose to hierarchically decompose the structure of the villa into five-plus-one contexts:\r\n* **The Front Basement: The Twin Stairs and the Colonnade-Basement**\r\n* **The Main Building**\r\n* **The Colonnade** _(precisely, A column)_\r\n* **The Front-Side of the Villa: The Main Roof and the Tympanum**\r\n* **The Back-Side of the Villa : Circular Glass**\r\n* **All the other stuff** _(such as windows, banisters, gratings and chimneypots)_\r\n\r\n_Please note:_ the code has been implemented with `export` functions, which means each of such contexts it's independent from others and can be drawn singularly.\r\n\r\n### Twin Stairs and Colonnade-Basement\r\n\r\nDue its symmetrical nature, Villa Foscari can be split in a right-half and a left-half.\r\n\r\nIf we focus on the last one, we'll obtain the other half simply with a `S` trasformation.\r\nMoreover, Rotational trasformations, `R`, are used to create the upper side of the stairs and due its squareness, we'll use mostly `CUBOID` functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTS Photo\r\nThe same trick can be used to draw the Colonnade_Basement, which is exactly between the twin stairs.\r\nColonnadeBasement Photo\r\n\r\nHere you can see the final result, combining the stairs and the basement.\r\nTS+CB Photo\r\n\r\n### Main Building\r\nExplain the Main Building\r\nMB Photo\r\n### The Colonnade\r\nThe colonnade is the most complex part of the project as it was decided to model the capital as an Archimedean spiral drawn by a `NUBS` (Archimedean spiral). It was also used a light-domain to avoid overloading the global model.\r\n\r\nTo draw the column instead, we chose to adopt divide-and-conquer-approach:\r\n* _Column-Base_ with `NUBS` and `ROTATIONAL SURFACE`.\r\n* _Column-Shaft_ with a `CYLINDER_SURFACE`\r\n* _Column-Capital_ still with `NUBS` `ROTATIONAL SURFACE` and `BEZIER`\r\n![Column](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg805/scaled.php?server=805&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\nThe entire Colonnade, which is basically a column replicated and then translated through the function REPLICA, counts ten columns advisably placed upon the Colonnade Basement.\r\n\r\n![Colonnade](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg507/scaled.php?server=507&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n### The Main Roof and the Roof upon the Colonnade\r\nThe roof upon the colonnade has been modeled with `CUBOID` roto-traslated.\r\nThe Main Roof counts a `SCALE` colonnade-roof, combined with 2*`CUBOID` and 2*`TRIANGLE_DOMAIN` advisably rotated and translated.\r\n\r\nNewRoofPhoto\r\n\r\n### The Backside of the Villa\r\n\r\nWith its circular glass, along with its asymmetrical facade, the back-side of the villa is one of the most complex part of the model.\r\nThe glass has been modeled as ....\r\nThe glass just above the circular one, has been modeled by a `2D DOMAIN` and a `TRIANGLE_DOMAIN`.\r\n\r\n![The Backside](http://imageshack.us/a/img24/1654/schermata092456189alle1.png)\r\n\r\n### Last but not least: All the other stuff\r\n\r\nAt the end of our rendering process we did take care of details, such as:\r\n\r\n*  **_Gratings_**  \r\n![Gratings](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg585/scaled.php?server=585&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n*  **_Banisters_** \r\n![Banisters](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg69/scaled.php?server=69&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n*  **_Windows and Shutters_** \r\n![Window](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg594/scaled.php?server=594&filename=schermata072456127alle2.png&res=landing)\r\n\r\n* **_Chimneys-pot upon the Main roof_**\r\n\r\n/*New CP Photo */\r\n\r\n### Final View\r\nThe complete model, as a result of the union of each hierarchical level, is as follows:\r\n\r\n### More Comparisons\r\n* _The Back-Side of the Villa_\r\n\r\n\r\n* _A view of the Villa_\r\n![A view of a side of the villa](http://imageshack.us/a/img838/1654/schermata092456189alle1.png)","note":"Don't delete this file!
